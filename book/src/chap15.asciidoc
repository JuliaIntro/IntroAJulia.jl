== Structs and Objects

At this point you know how to use functions to organize code and built-in types to organize data. The next step is to learn how to build your own types to organize both code and data. This is a big topic; it will take a few chapters to get there.


=== Composite Types

We have used many of Julia’s built-in types; now we are going to define a new type. As an example, we will create a type called +Point+ that represents a point in two-dimensional space.
(((type)))(((Point)))((("type", "programmer-defined", "Point", see="Point")))

In mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating the coordinates. For example, latexmath:[\(\left(0,0\right)\)] represents the origin, and latexmath:[\(\left(x,y\right)\)] represents the point latexmath:[\(x\)] units to the right and latexmath:[\(y\)] units up from the origin.

There are several ways we might represent points in Julia:

* We could store the coordinates separately in two variables, +x+ and +y+.

* We could store the coordinates as elements in an array or tuple.

* We could create a new type to represent points as objects.

Creating a new type is more complicated than the other options, but it has advantages that will be apparent soon.

A programmer-defined _composite type_ is also called a _struct_. The +struct+ definition for a point looks like this:
(((composite type)))(((struct)))((("keyword", "struct", see="struct")))(((end)))

[source,@julia-setup chap15]
----
struct Point
    x
    y
end
----

The header indicates that the new struct is called +Point+. The body defines the _attributes_ or _fields_ of the struct. The +Point+ struct has two fields: +x+ and +y+.
(((attribute)))((("field", see="attribute")))

A struct is like a factory for creating objects. To create a point, you call +Point+ as if it were a function having as arguments the values of the fields. When +Point+ is used as a function, it is called a _constructor_.
(((constructor)))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> p = Point(3.0, 4.0)
Point(3.0, 4.0)
----

The return value is a reference to a +Point+ object, which we assign to +p+.
(((reference)))

Creating a new object is called _instantiation_, and the object is an _instance_ of the type.
(((instatiation)))(((instance)))

When you print an instance, Julia tells you what type it belongs to and what the values of the atributes are.

Every object is an instance of some type, so “object” and “instance” are interchangeable. But in this chapter I use “instance” to indicate that I am talking about a programmer-defined type.

A state diagram that shows an object and its fields is called an _object diagram_; see <<fig15-1>>.
(((object diagram)))((("diagram", "object", see="object diagram")))

=== Structs are Immutable

You can get the values of the fields using +.+ notation:
(((.)))((("dot notation", see=".")))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> x = p.x
3.0
julia> p.y
4.0
----

The expression +p.x+ means, “Go to the object +p+ refers to and get the value of +x+.” In the example, we assign that value to a variable named +x+. There is no conflict between the variable +x+ and the field +x+.

You can use dot notation as part of any expression. For example:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> distance = sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)
5.0
----

Structs are however by default immutable, after construction the fields can not change value:
(((immutable)))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> p.y = 1.0
ERROR: setfield! immutable struct of type Point cannot be changed
----

This may seem odd at first, but it has several advantages:

* It can be more efficient.

* It is not possible to violate the invariants provided by the type's constructors (see <<constructor>>).

* Code using immutable objects can be easier to reason about.


=== Mutable Structs

Where required, mutable composite types can be declared with the keyword +mutable struct+. Here is the definition of a mutable point:
(((mutable composite type)))(((mutable struct)))((("keyword", "mutable struct", see="mutable struct")))(((MPoint)))((("type", "programmer-defined", "MPoint", see="MPoint")))

[source,@julia-setup chap15]
----
mutable struct MPoint
    x
    y
end
----

You can assign values to an instance of a mutable struct using dot notation:
(((.)))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> blank = MPoint(0.0, 0.0)
MPoint(0.0, 0.0)
julia> blank.x = 3.0
3.0
julia> blank.y = 4.0
4.0
----


=== Rectangles

Sometimes it is obvious what the fields of an object should be, but other times you have to make decisions. For example, imagine you are designing a type to represent rectangles. What fields would you use to specify the location and size of a rectangle? You can ignore angle; to keep things simple, assume that the rectangle is either vertical or horizontal.

There are at least two possibilities:

* You could specify one corner of the rectangle (or the center), the width, and the height.

* You could specify two opposing corners.

At this point it is hard to say whether either is better than the other, so we’ll implement the first one, just as an example.
(((Rectangle)))((("type", "programmer-defined", "Rectangle", see="Rectangle")))

[source,@julia-setup chap15]
----
"""
Represents a rectangle.

fields: width, height, corner.
"""
struct Rectangle
    width
    height
    corner
end
----

The docstring lists the fields: width and height are numbers; corner is a +Point+ object that specifies the lower-left corner.
(((docstring)))

To represent a rectangle, you have to instantiate a +Rectangle+ object:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> origin = MPoint(0.0, 0.0)
MPoint(0.0, 0.0)
julia> box = Rectangle(100.0, 200.0, origin)
Rectangle(100.0, 200.0, MPoint(0.0, 0.0))
----

<<fig15-2>> shows the state of this object. An object that is a field of another object is _embedded_. Because the +corner+ attribute refers to a mutable object, the latter is drawn outside the +Rectangle+ object.
(((embedded)))(((object diagram)))

[[fig15-2]]

image::images/fig152.svg[]


=== Instances as Arguments

You can pass an instance as an argument in the usual way. For example:
(((printpoint)))((("function", "programmer-defined", "printpoint", see="printpoint")))

[source,@julia-setup chap15]
----
function printpoint(p)
    println("($(p.x), $(p.y))")
end
----

+printpoint+ takes a +Point+ as an argument and displays it in mathematical notation. To invoke it, you can pass +p+ as an argument:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> printpoint(blank)
(3.0, 4.0)
----

==== Exercise 15-1

Write a function called +distancebetweenpoints+ that takes two points as arguments and returns the distance between them.
(((distancebetweenpoints)))((("function", "programmer-defined", "distancebetweenpoints", see="distancebetweenpoints")))

If a mutable struct object is passed to a function as an argument, the function can modify the fields of the object. For example, +movepoint!+ takes a mutable +Point+ object and two numbers, +dx+ and +dy+, and adds the numbers to respectively the +x+ and the +y+ attribute of the +Point+:
(((movepoint!)))((("function", "programmer-defined", "movepoint!", see="movepoint!")))

[source,@julia-setup chap15]
----
function movepoint!(p, dx, dy)
    p.x += dx
    p.y += dy
    nothing
end
----

Here is an example that demonstrates the effect:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> origin = MPoint(0.0, 0.0)
MPoint(0.0, 0.0)
julia> movepoint!(origin, 1.0, 2.0)

julia> origin
MPoint(1.0, 2.0)
----

Inside the function, +p+ is an alias for +origin+, so when the function modifies +p+, +origin+ changes.
(((aliasing)))

Passing an immutable +Point+ object to +movepoint!+ causes an error:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> movepoint!(p, 1.0, 2.0)
ERROR: setfield! immutable struct of type Point cannot be changed
----

You can however modify the value of a mutable attribute of an immutable object. For example, +moverectangle!+ has as arguments a +Rectangle+ object and two numbers, +dx+ and +dy+, and uses +movepoint!+ to move the corner of the rectangle:

[source,@julia-setup chap15]
----
function moverectangle!(rect, dx, dy)
  movepoint!(rect.corner, dx, dy)
end
----

Now +p+ in +movepoint!+ is an alias for +rect.corner+, so when +p+ is modified, +rect.corner+ changes also:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> box
Rectangle(100.0, 200.0, MPoint(0.0, 0.0))
julia> moverectangle!(box, 1.0, 2.0)

julia> box
Rectangle(100.0, 200.0, MPoint(1.0, 2.0))
----

[WARNING]
====
You cannot reassign a mutable attribute of an immutable object:
(((reassignment)))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> box.corner = MPoint(1.0, 2.0)
ERROR: setfield! immutable struct of type Rectangle cannot be changed
----
====

=== Instances as Return Values

Functions can return instances. For example, +findcenter+ takes a +Rectangle+ as an argument and returns a +Point+ that contains the coordinates of the center of the rectangle:
(((findcenter)))((("function", "programmer-defined", "findcenter", see="findcenter")))

[source,@julia-setup chap15]
----
function findcenter(rect)
    Point(rect.corner.x + rect.width / 2, rect.corner.y + rect.height / 2)
end
----

The expression +rect.corner.x+ means, “Go to the object +rect+ refers to and select the field named +corner+; then go to that object and select the field named +x+.”

Here is an example that passes +box+ as an argument and assigns the resulting +Point+ to +center+:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> center = findcenter(box)
Point(51.0, 102.0)
----


=== Copying

Aliasing can make a program difficult to read because changes in one place might have unexpected effects in another place. It is hard to keep track of all the variables that might refer to a given object.
(((aliasing)))

Copying an object is often an alternative to aliasing. Julia provides a function called +deepcopy+ that can duplicate any object:
(((copying)))(((deepcopy)))((("function", "Base", "deepcopy", see="deepcopy")))(((deep copy)))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> p1 = MPoint(3.0, 4.0)
MPoint(3.0, 4.0)
julia> p2 = deepcopy(p1)
MPoint(3.0, 4.0)
julia> p1 ≡ p2
false
julia> p1 == p2
false
----

The +≡+ operator indicates that +p1+ and +p2+ are not the same object, which is what we expected. But you might have expected +==+ to yield +true+ because these points contain the same data. In that case, you will be disappointed to learn that for mutable objects, the default behavior of the +==+ operator is the same as the +===+ operator; it checks object identity, not object equivalence. That’s because for mutable composite types, Julia doesn’t know what should be considered equivalent. At least, not yet.
(((==)))(((≡)))

==== Exercise 15-2

Create a +Point+ instance, make a copy of it and check the equivalence and the egality of both. The result can surprise you but it explains why aliasing is a non issue for an immutable object.


=== Debugging

When you start working with objects, you are likely to encounter some new exceptions. If you try to access a field that doesn’t exist, you get:
(((debugging)))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> p = Point(3.0, 4.0)
Point(3.0, 4.0)
julia> p.z = 1.0
ERROR: type Point has no field z
----

If you are not sure what type an object is, you can ask:
(((typeof)))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> typeof(p)
Point
----

You can also use +isa+ to check whether an object is an instance of a type:
(((isa)))((("operator", "Base", "isa", see="isa")))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> p isa Point
true
----

If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you can use the built-in function +fieldnames+:
(((deepcopy)))((("function", "Base", "deepcopy", see="deepcopy")))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> fieldnames(Point)
(:x, :y)
----

or the function +isdefined+:
(((isdefined)))((("function", "Base", "isdefined", see="isdefined")))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap15]
----
julia> isdefined(p, :x)
true
julia> isdefined(p, :z)
false
----

The first argument can be any object; the second argument is a symbol, +:+ followed by the name of the field.
(((:)))(((Symbol)))((("type", "Base", "Symbol", see="Symbol")))
